#For the questionnaire, we consciously chose to include different kinds of tools for user interaction in order to improve user experience.
#Each question gathers data that is used for the subsequent calculation of a predicted grade range. Each information is thereby weighted differently, based on their importance (see Report.py (line XXX)/heatmap).
